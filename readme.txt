# Random DAG Generation and Conditional Removability Check

## Overview

This project focuses on generating random Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and performing various analysis on them, particularly checking for t(c)-removabilities within the graph. The code includes functions for generating random DAGs, converting and visualizing them, and implementing algorithms for analyzing removable sets within these graphs.

## Features

- **Random DAG Generation**: Generate random connected DAGs with specified edge density.
- **Graph Analysis**:
  - Find children, parents, and other related sets of vertices.
  - Check if a set of vertices is  t(c)-removable.
  - Analyze inducing paths and mf-pairs.
- **Graph Visualization**: Visualize the generated DAG and highlight the results of the analysis.
- **Utilities**: Various utility functions for graph manipulation, including reversing graphs, finding ancestors, and checking connectivity.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- Required Libraries:
  - `networkx`
  - `matplotlib`

Install dependencies via pip:
```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Random DAG Generation**: 
    ```python
    from your_script import Generate_DAG
    
    n = 8  # Number of nodes
    edge_density = 0.2  # Probability of an edge between any pair of nodes
    
    DAG = Generate_DAG(n, edge_density)
    ```
   
2. **Check C-Removability**:
    ```python
    from your_script import ICRSA
    
    G = {
        'r1': {'m1': 'a', 'm2': 'b'},
        'r2': {'m1': 'c', 'm2': 'd', 'm3': 'e', 'r3': 'j'},
        'r3': {'m2': 'f'},
        'm1': {'m3': 'g'},
        'm2': {'m3': 'h'},
        'm3': {}
    }
    M = ['m1', 'm2', 'm3']
    
    is_removable = ICRSA(G, M)
    print(is_removable)
    ```

3. **Visualize Graph**:
    ```python
    from your_script import plot_result
    
    plot_result(DAG, 'output.png', title='Random DAG')
    ```

## Examples

Run the following examples in the main block:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    G = {
        'r1': {'m1': 'a', 'm2': 'b'},
        'r2': {'m1': 'c', 'm2': 'd', 'm3': 'e', 'r3': 'j'},
        'r3': {'m2': 'f'},
        'm1': {'m3': 'g'},
        'm2': {'m3': 'h'},
        'm3': {}
    }
    M = ['m1', 'm2', 'm3']
    print(ICRSA(G, M))
    print(ITRSA(G, M))
   
```

## Notes

- The code also includes several functions for more advanced graph manipulations, such as finding Markov blankets, inducing paths, and moralizing the DAG.
- The primary focus is on exploring inducing paths in DAGs and how it relates to the removability of certain vertex sets.
